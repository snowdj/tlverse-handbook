<p>The roadmap of statistical learning is concerned with the process of translating
real-world scientific questions to mathematical formalisms
necessary for formulating relevant statistical inference problems.
This involves viewing data as a random variable (complete with its own
underlying probability distribution), incorporating scientific knowledge into
the choice of statistical model, selecting a statistical target parameter that
represents an answer to the scientific question of interest, and developing
efficient estimators of the statistical estimand.</p>

<h3>(1) Data: A random variable with a probability distribution, <span class="math inline">\(O \sim P_0\)</span><a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#data-a-random-variable-with-a-probability-distribution-o-sim-p_0"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>The dataset we are confronted with is the collection of the results of a
scientific (or natural) experiment. We can view the data as a <em>random variable</em>;
that is, if the same experiment were to be repeated, we should expect to see a
different realization of the data generated by the same underlying law governing
the experiment in question. In particular, if the experiment were repeated many
times, the underlying probability distribution generating the data, <span class="math inline">\(P_0\)</span>, would
be revealed. The observed data on a single unit, <span class="math inline">\(O\)</span>, may be thought of as being
drawn from this probability distribution <span class="math inline">\(P_0\)</span>. Most often, we have <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>
<em>independent and identically distributed</em> (i.i.d.) observations of the random
variable <span class="math inline">\(O\)</span> in our dataset. Then, the observed data is the collection <span class="math inline">\(O_1, \ldots, O_n\)</span>, where the subscripts denote the individual observational units.
While not all data are i.i.d., this is certainly the most common case in applied
data analysis. There are a number of techniques for handling non-i.i.d. data,
including establishing conditional independence, such that conditional on some
variable (e.g., subject ID for repeated measures data) the i.i.d. assumption
holds, and incorporating inferential corrections for repeated or clustered
observations, to name but a few.</p>
<div id="the-empirical-probability-measure-p_n" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>The empirical probability measure, <span class="math inline">\(P_n\)</span><a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#the-empirical-probability-measure-p_n"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h4>
<p>With <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> i.i.d. observations in hand, we can define an empirical probability
measure, <span class="math inline">\(P_n\)</span>. The empirical probability measure is an approximation of the
true probability measure, <span class="math inline">\(P_0\)</span>, allowing us to learn from the observed data.
For example, we can define the empirical probability measure of a set of
variables, say <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span>, to be the proportion of observations that belong in <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span>.
That is,
<span class="math display">\[\begin{equation*}
  P_n(W) = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n} \I(O_i \in W)
\end{equation*}\]</span></p>
<p>In order to understand the scope for learning from a particular dataset, we next
need to ask <em>“What do we know about the process that led to the data’s
generation?”</em> This brings us on to Step 2.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="defining-the-statistical-model-m-such-that-p_0-in-m" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>(2) Defining the statistical model <span class="math inline">\(\M\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(P_0 \in \M\)</span><a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#defining-the-statistical-model-m-such-that-p_0-in-m"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>The statistical model <span class="math inline">\(\M\)</span> is the set of all possible probability distributions
that could describe the process by which our observed data have been generated,
appropriately constrained by background scientific knowledge. Often, <span class="math inline">\(\M\)</span> is
necessarily very large (i.e., non-parametric), reflecting the fact that
statistical knowledge about <span class="math inline">\(P_0\)</span> is limited.</p>
<p>If <span class="math inline">\(P_0\)</span> is described by a finite number of parameters, then the statistical
model is referred to as <em>parametric</em>. Such an assumption is made, for example,
by the proposition that <span class="math inline">\(O\)</span> has a Normal distribution with mean <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> and
variance <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2\)</span>. More generally, a parametric model may be defined as</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{equation*}
  \M(\theta) = \{P_{\theta} : \theta \in \R^d \},
\end{equation*}\]</span>
which describes a constrained statistical model consisting of all distributions
<span class="math inline">\(P_{\theta}\)</span> that are indexed by some finite, <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span>-dimensional parameter
<span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>.</p>
<p>The assumption that <span class="math inline">\(P_0\)</span> has a specific, parametric form is made quite
commonly. Unfortunately, this is even the case when such assumptions are not
supported by domain knowledge about the data-generating process. This practice
of oversimplification in the current, and traditional, culture of statistical
data analysis typically complicates or entirely thwarts any attempt to reliably
answer the scientific question at hand. Why, you ask? Consider how much
knowledge one must have to <em>know</em> (beyond a shadow of a doubt) that the
data-generating distribution underlying a given dataset is, in fact, governed by
just two parameters, as is the case with the ubiquitously relied upon Normal
distribution. Similarly, main terms Cox proportional hazards, logistic
regression, and linear models imply a highly constrained statistical model, and
if any of the assumptions are unwarranted then there will be bias in their
result (except when treatment is randomized). The philosophy used to justify
parametric assumptions is rooted in misinterpretations of the often-quoted
saying of George Box, that “All models are wrong but some are useful,” which has
been irresponsibly used to encourage the data analyst to make arbitrary modeling
choices. However, when one makes such unfounded assumptions, it is more likely
that <span class="math inline">\(\M\)</span> does not contain <span class="math inline">\(P_0\)</span>, in which case the statistical model is said to
be misspecified. Statistical model misspecification introduces a bias that leads
to misleading, unreliable results and inference.</p>
<p>The result of unwarranted assumptions and oversimplifications is a practice of
statistical data science in which starkly disparate answers to the same
scientific problem emerge. Practically, this is owed to the application of
distinct statistical techniques under differing modeling decisions and
assumptions made (but not communicated well) by different data analysts. Even in
the nascent days of statistical data analysis, it was recognized that it is “far
better [to develop] an approximate answer to the right question…than an exact
answer to the wrong question, which can always be made precise”
<span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-tukey1962future" role="doc-biblioref">Tukey, 1962</a>)</span>, though traditional statistics failed to heed this advice for
a number of decades <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-donoho2017fifty" role="doc-biblioref">Donoho, 2017</a>)</span>. The roadmap avoids this bias by defining
the statistical model through a representation of the true data-generating
distribution underlying the observed data. The ultimate goal is to formulate the
statistical estimation problem <em>precisely</em> (up to the constraints imposed by
available scientific knowledge), so that one can then tailor the estimation
procedure to the motivating scientific problem.</p>
<p>It is crucial that the domain scientist(s) have absolute clarity about what is
<em>actually known</em> about the process/experiment that generated the data, and that
this is communicated to data scientists with as much detail as possible. This
knowledge is rarely ground truth itself, but instead comes in the form of
scientific conventions, accepted hypotheses, and operational assumptions.
<!--
rp: This is vague. What's an example of scientific conventions, example of
accepted hypotheses, and example of operational assumptions that would be
incorporated in M?
-->
It is then the data scientist’s responsibility to translate the domain knowledge
into statistical knowledge about <span class="math inline">\(P_0\)</span>, and then to define the statistical model
<span class="math inline">\(\M\)</span> so that it respects what is known about <span class="math inline">\(P_0\)</span> and makes no further
restrictions. In this manner, we can ensure that <span class="math inline">\(P_0\)</span> is contained in <span class="math inline">\(\M\)</span>,
which we refer to generally as defining a <em>realistic</em> statistical model <span class="math inline">\(\M\)</span>.</p>
<p>Defining <span class="math inline">\(\M\)</span> realistically requires a shift in the paradigm of statistical
problem solving. Instead of considering the methods/software one is familiar
with and then trying to solve most problems with that toolbox, one must obtain a
deep understanding of the experiment and scientific question first and then
formulate a plan for learning from the data in a way that respects this. This
requires statisticians to have not only solid methodological and theoretical
foundations, but good communication skills, as several meetings with domain
experts are typically required to review details of the study, possibly refine
of the question of interest, translate technical details, and interpret the
findings in a way that is statistically correct and agreeable with
non-statistician domain experts. Unfortunately, communication between
statisticians and non-statistician researchers is often fraught with
misinterpretation. This is to be expected, as each have their own expertise, but
proper communication about the underlying science and the motivating study can
help to ensure each have appropriate context for a given statistical data
analysis. The roadmap provides a principled mechanism for learning from data
realistically, so that what is learned from the data represents a reliable and
reproducible approximation of the answer to the scientific question of interest.
As the roadmap provides a rigorous method for translating scientific knowledge
and questions into a statistical framework that can be used to learn from data,
it is an invaluable tool to guide communication between statisticians and
non-statistician domain scientists. This brings us to our next step in the
roadmap, <em>“What are we trying to learn from the data?”</em></p>
</div>
<div id="the-statistical-target-parameter-psi-and-statistical-estimand-psi_0" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>(3) The statistical target parameter <span class="math inline">\(\Psi\)</span> and statistical estimand <span class="math inline">\(\psi_0\)</span><a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#the-statistical-target-parameter-psi-and-statistical-estimand-psi_0"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>The statistical target parameter, <span class="math inline">\(\Psi\)</span>, is defined as a mapping from the
statistical model, <span class="math inline">\(\M\)</span>, to the parameter space. Usually, the parameter space is
a real number (but not necessarily so), in which case we can formally define the
target parameter as the mapping <span class="math inline">\(\Psi: \M \rightarrow \R\)</span>. The statistical
estimand may be seen as a representation of the quantity that we wish to learn
from the data, the answer to a well-specified – often causal – question of
interest about a particular target population. In contrast to ordinary
statistical estimands, causal estimands require an extra set of assumptions to
allow for their <em>identification from the observed data</em>. Based on causal models
<span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-hernan2022causal" role="doc-biblioref">Hernán and Robins, 2022</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-pearl2009causality" role="doc-biblioref">Pearl, 2009</a>)</span>, identification assumptions are
untestable and must be justified through a combination of knowledge about the
system under study or the process by which the experiment was conducted. These
assumptions are described in greater detail in the following section on <a href="roadmap.html#causal">causal
target parameters</a>.</p>
<p>For a simple example, consider a dataset containing observations of a survival
time on every adult, for which our question of interest is “What’s the
probability that an adult lives longer than five years?” We have,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{equation*}
  \psi_0 = \Psi(P_0) = \E_{P_0}(O &gt; 5) = \int_5^{\infty} dP_0(o).
\end{equation*}\]</span></p>
<p>This answer to this question is the <strong>statistical estimand,
<span class="math inline">\(\Psi(P_0)=\psi_0\)</span></strong>, which is the quantity we wish to learn from the data. As
discussed above, back-and-forth communication between domain scientists and
statisticians is often required to define <span class="math inline">\(\M\)</span> realistically, and to finalize
<span class="math inline">\(\Psi\)</span> and the target population such that the question is supported in the
data. For instance, say we are interested in learning the average effect of a
headache medication for treating migraines in adults and we learn that no one
with high blood pressure can receive the medication. In the next meeting with
domain scientists, we might suggest that the target population be modified to
adults without high blood pressure or ask a question involving a dynamic
treatment such that within <span class="math inline">\(\Psi\)</span> adults with high blood pressure are never
considered as individuals who could receive treatment. Once we have defined <span class="math inline">\(O\)</span>,
<span class="math inline">\(\M\)</span> realistically and <span class="math inline">\(\Psi\)</span>, we have formally defined the statistical
estimation problem. Next comes Step 4: “<em>How do we learn from the data the
approximate answer to the question of interest?</em>”</p>
</div>
<div id="the-estimator-hatpsi-and-estimate-psi_n" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>(4) The estimator <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\Psi}\)</span> and estimate <span class="math inline">\(\psi_n\)</span><a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#the-estimator-hatpsi-and-estimate-psi_n"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>To obtain a good approximation of the statistical estimand, we need an estimator
<span class="math inline">\(\hat{\Psi}\)</span>, an <em>a priori</em>-specified algorithm defined as a mapping from the set
of the set of possible empirical distributions <span class="math inline">\(P_n\)</span> (which live in a
non-parametric statistical model <span class="math inline">\(\M_{NP}\)</span>) to the parameter space for our
target parameter of interest: <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\Psi} : \M_{NP} \rightarrow \R\)</span>. In other
words, <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\Psi}\)</span> is a function that takes as input the observed data, a
realization of <span class="math inline">\(P_n\)</span>, and then outputs a value in the parameter space. Where the
estimator may be seen as an operator that maps the observed data’s corresponding
empirical distribution to a value in the parameter space, the numerical output
produced by such a function is the <strong>estimate, <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\Psi}(P_n)=\psi_n\)</span></strong>. Thus,
<span class="math inline">\(\psi_n\)</span> is an element of the parameter space as informed by the empirical
probability distribution <span class="math inline">\(P_n\)</span> of the observed data <span class="math inline">\(O_1, \ldots, O_n\)</span>. If we
plug in a realization of <span class="math inline">\(P_n\)</span> (based on a sample size <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> of the random
variable <span class="math inline">\(O\)</span>, we get back an estimate <span class="math inline">\(\psi_n\)</span> of the true parameter value
<span class="math inline">\(\psi_0\)</span>.
<!--
nh: the use of $\hat{\Psi}(\cdot)$ seems to imply an approximate mapping, i.e.,
$\hat{\Psi}(\cdot)$ is _not_ $\Psi()$--almost sounds as though we're answering
an approximate version of the question represented by the mapping $\Psi(\cdot)$

rp: Yes, with $\hat{\Psi}$ we are approximating $\Psi$, $\hat{\Psi}$ is an
estimator of $\Psi$
-->
As we have motivated in step 2, it is imperative to consider realistic
statistical models for estimation. Therefore, flexible estimators that allow for
parts of the data-generating process to be unrestricted are necessary.
Semiparametric theory and empirical process theory provide a framework for
constructing, benchmarking, and understanding the behavior of estimators that
depend on flexible estimation strategies in realistic statistical models. In
general, desirable properties of an estimator are that it is regular
asymptotically linear (RAL) and efficient, thereby admitting a Normal limit
distribution that has minimal variance. Substitution/plug-in RAL estimators are
also advantageous: they are guaranteed to remain within the bounds of <span class="math inline">\(\M\)</span> and,
relative to estimators that are not plug-in, have improved bias and variance in
finite samples. In-depth discussion of the theory and these properties are
available in the literature <span class="citation">(e.g., <a href="references.html#ref-kennedy2016semiparametric" role="doc-biblioref">Kennedy, 2016</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-vdl2011targeted" role="doc-biblioref">van der Laan and Rose, 2011</a>)</span>. We review a few key concepts in the following step.</p>
<p>In order to quantify the uncertainty in our estimate of the target parameter,
part of the process of conducting statistical inference, an understanding of the
sampling distribution of our estimator is necessary. This brings us to Step 5:
“<em>How confident should we be in our statistical answer to the scientific
question?</em>”</p>

</h3>
<p>Since the estimator <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\Psi}\)</span> is a function of the empirical distribution
<span class="math inline">\(P_n\)</span>, the estimator itself is a random variable with a sampling distribution.
Therefore, if we repeat the experiment of drawing <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> observations, we would
every time end up with a different realization of our estimate. The hypothetical
distribution of these estimates is the sampling distribution of the estimator.</p>
<p>A primary goal in the construction of estimators is to be able to derive their
asymptotic sampling distribution through a theoretical analysis involving
empirical process theory. In this regard, an important property of the
estimators on which we focus is their asymptotic linearity. In particular,
asymptotic linearity states that the difference between the estimator and the
target parameter (i.e., the truth) can be represented, asymptotically, as an
average of i.i.d. random variables plus an asymptotically negligible remainder
term:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{equation*}
  \hat{\Psi}(P_n) - \Psi(P_0) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n IC(P_0)(O_i) +
    o_p(n^{-1/2}),
\end{equation*}\]</span>
where the influence curve (IC) is a function of the observed data <span class="math inline">\(O\)</span> but the
function itself is defined by the underlying data-generating distribution <span class="math inline">\(P_0\)</span>.
Based on this asymptotic approximation, the Central Limit Theorem can be used to
show</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{equation*}
  \sqrt{n} \left(\hat{\Psi}(P_n) - \Psi(P_0)\right) \sim N(0, \sigma^2_{IC}),
\end{equation*}\]</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2_{IC}\)</span> is the variance of <span class="math inline">\(IC(P_0)(O)\)</span>. Given an estimate of
<span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2_{IC}\)</span>, it is then possible to construct classic, <em>asymptotically
accurate</em> Wald-type confidence intervals (CIs) and hypothesis tests. For
example, a standard <span class="math inline">\((1 - \alpha)\)</span> CI takes the form</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{equation*}
  \psi_n \pm Z \frac{\hat{\sigma}_{IC}}{\sqrt{n}} \ ,
\end{equation*}\]</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span> is the <span class="math inline">\((1 - \alpha / 2)^\text{th}\)</span> quantile of the standard Normal
distribution. Following convention, we will often be interested in constructing
95% two-tailed CIs, corresponding to probability mass <span class="math inline">\(\alpha/2 = 0.025\)</span> in each
tail of the limit distribution; thus, we will take <span class="math inline">\(Z \approx 1.96\)</span> as the
quantile.</p>
<p>Steps (1)–(5) of the roadmap define the statistical analysis plan, all of which
can be done before any data is revealed. The last step of the roadmap involves
interpreting the results obtained in step (4) and (5) and therefore requires the
data to be analyzed; however, any additional analysis that may take place as
part of step (6) can be pre-specified as well. This final step of the roadmap
addresses the question, “<em>what is the interpretation and robustness of the
study’s findings, and what conclusions can be drawn from them?</em>”</p>

<h3>(6) Make substantive conclusion<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#make-substantive-conclusion"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>Making the substantive conclusion involves interpreting the study findings. It
also provides an opportunity to ask follow-up questions that might be addressed
later and/or discuss issues that can inform future studies. Statistical
estimands <span class="math inline">\(\psi_0\)</span> can have statistical (noncausal) and causal interpretations.
Both are often of interest and can be provided. The target population should be
clearly mentioned in the interpretation, regardless of whether it’s a purely
statistical or causal interpretation, to curtail extrapolation of results.</p>
<p>The major distinction between statistical versus causal interpretations is that
the latter relies on untestable so-called “identifiability” assumptions. In the
following section, we review these assumptions one-by-one. Here, we focus on the
interpretation and robustness of the study findings with respect to them.
Specifically, causal target parameters cannot be estimated from observed data
without additional identifiability assumptions, and so the validity of a
result’s causal interpretation hinges on them holding in the data. The more
these assumptions do not hold, the larger the <em>causal gap</em>, the difference
between the statistical estimand and the causal estimand. In a perfect
randomized control trial with no loss to follow-up, the causal gap will be zero
as the statistical and causal estimands are equivalent. In <span class="citation">Dı́az and van der Laan (<a href="references.html#ref-diaz2013sensitivity" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a>)</span>,
a non-parametric sensitivity analysis for assessing the impact of a hypothesized
causal gaps on estimates and inference is proposed. In <span class="citation">Gruber <em>et al.</em> (<a href="references.html#ref-gruber2022targeted" role="doc-biblioref">2023</a>)</span> and
<span class="citation">Gruber <em>et al.</em> (<a href="references.html#ref-gruber2022evaluating" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a>)</span>, there are example implementations of the methods proposed
in <span class="citation">Dı́az and van der Laan (<a href="references.html#ref-diaz2013sensitivity" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a>)</span>; in particular, the difference between adjusted and
unadjusted effect estimates is used to define a range of possible causal gaps
relative to this difference. If the question of interest is causal, then such a
model-free sensitivity analysis (possibly as a complement to other sensitivity
analyses) is recommended to assess the robustness of the study findings.</p>

<span class="header-section-number">4.2</span> Summary of the Roadmap<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#roadmap-summary"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>Data collected across <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> i.i.d. units, <span class="math inline">\(O_1, \ldots, O_n\)</span>, may be viewed as a
collection of random variables arising from the same underlying probability
distribution <span class="math inline">\(\P_0\)</span>. This is expressed by denoting the collection of data as
being generated as <span class="math inline">\(O_1, \ldots, O_n \sim P_0\)</span>. Domain knowledge about the
experiment that generated the data (e.g., if the treatment was randomized, if
the treatment decision or loss to follow-up depended on a subset of covariates,
time ordering in which the variables were added to the data) is translated by
the statistician / data scientist to define the statistical model <span class="math inline">\(\M\)</span>, a
postulated space of candidate probability distributions that is supposed to
contain <span class="math inline">\(P_0\)</span>. In particular, the roadmap emphasizes the critical role of
defining <span class="math inline">\(\M\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(P_0\)</span> is guaranteed to be encapsulated by it, <span class="math inline">\(P_0 \in \M\)</span>. By only limiting <span class="math inline">\(\M\)</span> based on domain knowledge about the experiment (i.e.,
reality) — opposed to constraining it unrealistically (e.g., assuming a
restrictive functional form, like a main terms linear/logistic model, describes
<span class="math inline">\(P_0\)</span>) — it can be ensured that <span class="math inline">\(P_0 \in \M\)</span>, and we refer to this as defining
a realistic statistical model. Often, knowledge that can be used to constrain
<span class="math inline">\(\M\)</span> is very limited, and so <span class="math inline">\(\M\)</span> must be very large to define it such that <span class="math inline">\(P_0 \in \M\)</span>; hence, realistic statistical models are often termed semi- or
non-parametric, since they are too large to be indexed by a finite-dimensional
set of parameters. Necessarily, our statistical query must begin with, “What are
we trying to learn from the data?”, a question whose answer is captured by the
statistical target parameter, <span class="math inline">\(\Psi\)</span>, a function defined by the true
data-generating distribution <span class="math inline">\(P_0\)</span>, that maps <span class="math inline">\(\M\)</span> into the statistical
estimand, <span class="math inline">\(\psi_0\)</span>. At this stage, the statistical estimation problem is
formally defined, allowing for the use of statistical theory to guide the
construction of estimators, which are algorithms that approximate the answer the
question of interest by learning from the data. Desirable properties of an
estimator are that it is unbiased, efficient, plug-in, and robust in finite
samples. If the question of interest is causal, then a model-free sensitivity
analysis is recommended to assess the robustness of the study’s findings under
various hypothesized causal gaps.</p>

</h2>
<p>In many cases, we are interested in problems that ask questions regarding the
<em>causal effect</em> of an intervention, whether an assigned treatment (e.g., a
prescribed drug) or a “naturally occurring” exposure (e.g., pollution from a
nearby factory), on a future outcome of interest. These causal effects may be
defined as summaries of the population of interest (e.g., population mean of a
particular outcome) under contrasting interventions (e.g., comparing the treated
to the untreated condition). For example, a causal effect could be defined as
the mean difference of a disease outcome between two <em>causal contrasts</em>,
counterfactual cases in which the study population were set to uniformly
experience low pollution levels for some pollutant, and in which the same
population were set to uniformly experience high levels of the same pollutant.</p>
<p>There are different ways of operationalizing the theoretical experiments that
generate the counterfactual data necessary for describing such causal contrasts
of interest. We could simply assume that the counterfactual outcomes exist in
theory for all treatment contrasts of interest <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-imbens2015causal" role="doc-biblioref">Imbens and Rubin, 2015</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-neyman1938contribution" role="doc-biblioref">Neyman, 1938</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-rubin2005causal" role="doc-biblioref">Rubin, 2005</a>)</span>, which may be encoded in so-called “science
tables”. Alternatively, we could consider interventions on structural causal
models (SCMs) <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-pearl1995causal" role="doc-biblioref">Pearl, 1995</a>, <a href="references.html#ref-pearl2009causality" role="doc-biblioref">2009</a>)</span>, which may be represented
by directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). Both frameworks allow for the known or
hypothesized set of relationships between variables in the system under study to
be encoded and mathematically formalized.</p>

causal parameters. Estimators of statistical parameters that correspond, under
standard but untestable <em>identifiability</em> assumptions, to these causal
parameters are introduced below. DAGs are a particularly useful tool for
visually expressing what we know about the causal relations among variables in
the system under study. Ignoring exogenous <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> terms (explained below), we

<p>While DAGs like the above provide a convenient means by which to express the
causal relations between variables, these same causal relations can be
equivalently represented by an SCM:
<span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
  W &amp;= f_W(U_W) \\
  A &amp;= f_A(W, U_A) \\
  Y &amp;= f_Y(W, A, U_Y),
\end{align*}\]</span>
where the <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>’s are unspecified deterministic functions that generate the
corresponding random variables as a function of the variable’s “parents” (i.e.,
upstream nodes with arrows into the given random variable) in the DAG, and the
unobserved, exogenous error terms (i.e., the <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span>’s). An SCM may be thought of as
a representation of the algorithm that produces the data, <span class="math inline">\(O\)</span>, in the population
of interest. Much of statistics and data science is devoted to discovering
properties of this system of equations (e.g., estimation of the functional form
<span class="math inline">\(f_Y\)</span> governing the outcome variable <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>).</p>
<!--
where $U_W$, $U_A$, and $U_Y$ represent the unmeasured exogenous background
characteristics that influence the value of each variable. In the NPSEM, $f_W$,
$f_A$ and $f_Y$ denote that each variable (for $W$, $A$ and $Y$, respectively)
is a function of its parents and unmeasured background characteristics, but
note that there is no imposition of any particular functional constraints(e.g.,
linear, logit-linear, only one interaction, etc.). For this reason, they are
called non-parametric structural equation models (NPSEMs). The DAG and set of
nonparametric structural equations represent exactly the same information and
so may be used interchangeably.
-->
<p>The first hypothetical experiment we will consider is assigning exposure to the
entire population and observing the outcome, and then withholding exposure to
the same population and observing the outcome. This corresponds to a comparison
of the outcome distribution in the population under two distinct interventions:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>
<span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is set to <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> for all individuals, and</li>
<li>
<span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is set to <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> for all individuals.</li>
</ol>
<p>These interventions may be thought of as operations that imply changes
to the structural equations in the system under study. For the case <span class="math inline">\(A = 1\)</span>, we
have
<span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
  W &amp;= f_W(U_W) \\
  A &amp;= 1 \\
  Y(1) &amp;= f_Y(W, 1, U_Y) \ ,
\end{align*}\]</span>
while, for the case <span class="math inline">\(A=0\)</span>,
<span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
  W &amp;= f_W(U_W) \\
  A &amp;= 0 \\
  Y(0) &amp;= f_Y(W, 0, U_Y) \ .
\end{align*}\]</span></p>
<p>In these equations, <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is no longer a function of <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span> because the intervention
on the system set <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> deterministically
to one of the values <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> consistent with the intervention performed. The
new symbols <span class="math inline">\(Y(1)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y(0)\)</span> indicate the values the outcome variable would
take in the population of interest when it is generated by removing the
contribution of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(f_Y\)</span> and instead setting <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> to the values <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>,
respectively. The variables <span class="math inline">\(Y(1)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y(0)\)</span> are often called counterfactuals
(since they arise from interventions that run contrary to fact) and are, in
other frameworks, called the <em>potential outcomes</em> of <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>
[<span class="citation">Neyman (<a href="references.html#ref-neyman1938contribution" role="doc-biblioref">1938</a>)</span>; rubin2005causal; imbens2015causal]. The difference in
the counterfactual means of the outcome under these two interventions defines a
well known causal parameter that is most often called the “average treatment
effect” (ATE) and is denoted</p>
<p><span class="math display" id="eq:ate">\[\begin{equation}
  ATE = \E_X[Y(1) - Y(0)],
  \tag{4.1}
\end{equation}\]</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(\E_X(\cdot)\)</span> is the expectation taken over the theoretical (unobservable)
full data (i.e., <span class="math inline">\(X = (W, Y(1), Y(0))\)</span>) distribution <span class="math inline">\(P_X\)</span>. Note that the full
data structure <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is, by its very definition, unobservable since one can never
observe both of <span class="math inline">\(Y(1)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y(0)\)</span> for the same observational unit.</p>
<p>We can define much more complicated interventions on SCMs, such as interventions
based upon dynamic rules (which assign particular interventions based on a
function of the covariates <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span>), stochastic rules (which can even account for
the natural value of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> observed in the absence of the intervention), and much
more. Each results in a different target causal parameter and entails different
identifiability assumptions discussed below.</p>

<div id="identifiability" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Identifiability<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#identifiability"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>

<p>Since we can never simultaneously observe <span class="math inline">\(Y(0)\)</span>, the counterfactual outcome
when <span class="math inline">\(A=0\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(Y(1)\)</span>, the counterfactual outcome when <span class="math inline">\(A=1\)</span>, we cannot
estimate their difference <span class="math inline">\(Y(1) - Y(0)\)</span> (the individual treatment effect), which
appears in Equation <a href="roadmap.html#eq:ate">(4.1)</a> (inside the expectation <span class="math inline">\(\E_X(\cdot)\)</span> that
defines ATE). This is called the <em>Fundamental Problem of Causal Inference</em>
<span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-holland1986statistics" role="doc-biblioref">Holland, 1986</a>)</span>. Thus, one of the primary activities in causal
inference is to <em>identify</em> the assumptions necessary to express causal
quantities of interest as functions of the data-generating distribution of the
observed data. To do this, we must make assumptions under which such quantities
may be estimated from the observed data <span class="math inline">\(O \sim P_0\)</span> and its corresponding
data-generating distribution <span class="math inline">\(P_0\)</span>. Fortunately, given the causal model
specified in the SCM above, we can, with a handful of untestable assumptions,
estimate the ATE from observational data. These assumptions may be summarized as
follows.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p><span id="def:consist-ass" class="definition"><strong>Definition 4.1  (Consistency) </strong></span>The outcome for unit <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(Y_i(a)\)</span> whenever <span class="math inline">\(A_i = a\)</span>, which may be thought of

<p>Technically speaking, only the latter two of these assumptions are necessary
when working within the SCM framework, as the first two are implied properties
of an SCM for i.i.d. data (if you’re really curious, see this commentary of
<span class="citation">Pearl (<a href="references.html#ref-pearl2010brief" role="doc-biblioref">2010</a>)</span> for an extended discussion). We introduce all four
identification assumptions because they are most often considered together, and
all four are necessary when working within the potential outcomes framework
<span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-imbens2015causal" role="doc-biblioref">Imbens and Rubin, 2015</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-rubin2005causal" role="doc-biblioref">Rubin, 2005</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Under these assumptions, the ATE may be re-written as a function of <span class="math inline">\(P_0\)</span>, the

<p><span class="math display" id="eq:estimand">\[\begin{align}

  \tag{4.2}
\end{align}\]</span>
In words, the ATE is the mean difference in the predicted outcome values for
each subject, under the contrast of treatment conditions (<span class="math inline">\(A = 0\)</span> versus <span class="math inline">\(A = 1\)</span>), in the population (when averaged over all observations). Thus, a parameter
of a theoretical complete (or “full”) data distribution can be represented as an
estimand of the observed data distribution. Significantly, there is nothing
about the representation in Equation <a href="roadmap.html#eq:estimand">(4.2)</a> that requires
parameteric assumptions; thus, the regression functions on the right hand side
may be estimated without restrictive assumptions about their underlying
functional forms. With different parameters, there will be potentially
different identifiability assumptions and the resulting estimands can be
functions of different components of <span class="math inline">\(P_0\)</span>. We discuss several more complex
estimands in subsequent chapters.</p>

### Missingness {-}

TODO: Ask Mark to add note about this.

-Ben (09/20/2022)-
As a specific methodological issue, why impute using median/mode, for example
compared to a multiple imputation approach? I suggest that the statistical
reviewer is consulted on the implications of this. Regardless of the
appropriateness of the method, for transparency there should be a table that
shows extent of missingness by cohort and variable. Also for transparency, a
complete case analysis should be presented as a sensitivity analysis.

-Mark (09/20/2022)-
Yes, that is the clear argument: i.e. if we have A is independent of Y_a given
W*, then there is no missigness issue, where W* is W_j,Deltaj, across all
components j, Delta_j indicator of W_j being measured. So then estimand is E
E(Y|A=1,W*)-E(Y|A=0,W*)) and it equals the ATE. If we can make the case that
this assumption is violated but for some particular component W_1, we would
have the randomizaiton given W*,W_1, but not given W*, then one can view W_1 as
subject to missing. In that case, we want to learn E_{W*,W_1}
E(Y|A=1,W*,W_1)-E(Y|A=1,W*,W_1), which is not yet a function of distribution of
data. So we need to assume that missingness of W_1 is MAR e..g misisngness
indicator Delta_{W_1} is a functio of observed Y and A,W* (e.g two stage
designs), or only a function of W*,A, beyond independent noise. We can then
obtain the desired identification result for this quantity and develop the
resulting TMLE. Or one could use the TMLE in world where W_1 is measured, with
inverse prob of missing weights (IPCW TMLE, e.g Rose, vdL for two stage
designs).

Regarding reference, just refer to ATE identification result and make clear
that it is not unreasonable to make this RA assumption given W*. Or that even
when there is a concern, there is no particular reason to think that given the
full W it would be resolved. If we feel that RA assumption is violated, and no
satisfactory few W_1 full observed resolve the problem, then one could address
it in the sensitivity analysis.

I would think various articles, e.g. Neugebauer, Schnitzer, Petersen, Hubbard,
Mertens, etc involving real data analysis, have done this by now and can thus
be referenced as well.

-Ben (09/20/2022)-
Regarding Mark's thorough explanation, I think I am comfortable with us simply
making the assumption:
if we have A is independent of Y_a given W*, then there is no missigness issue,
where W* is W_j,Deltaj, across all components j, Delta_j indicator of W_j being
measured. So then estimand is E E(Y|A=1,W*)-E(Y|A=0,W*)) and it equals the ATE.
