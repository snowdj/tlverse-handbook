## Why _Stochastic_ Interventions?

Stochastic treatment regimes, or _stochastic interventions_, constitute a
relatively simple yet extremely flexible and expressive framework for defining
_realistic_ causal effects. In contrast to intervention regimens discussed
previously, stochastic interventions may be applied to nearly any manner of
treatment variable -- binary, ordinal, continuous -- allowing for a rich set of
causal effects to be defined through this formalism. This chapter focuses on
examining a few types of stochastic interventions that may be applied to
_continuous_ treatment variables, to which static and dynamic treatment regimes
cannot easily be applied. Notably, the resultant causal effects conveniently are
endowed with an interpretation echoing that of ordinary regression adjustment.

In the next chapter, we will introduce two alternative uses of stochastic
interventions -- a recently formulated intervention applicable to binary
treatment variables [@kennedy2019nonparametric] and the definition of causal
effects in the presence of post-treatment, or mediating, variables. Here, we
will focus on the tools provided in the [`tmle3shift` R
package](https://github.com/tlverse/tmle3shift), which exposes targeted minimum
loss-based estimators of the causal effects of stochastic interventions that
additively shift the observed value of the treatment variable. More
comprehensive, technical presentations of some aspects of the material in this
chapter appear in @diaz2012population, @diaz2018stochastic,
@hejazi2020efficient, and @hejazi2021semiparametric.

## Data Structure and Notation

Let us return to the familiar data unit $O = (W, A, Y)$, where $W$ denote
baseline covariates (e.g., age, biological sex, education level), $A$ a
treatment variable (e.g., dose of nutritional supplements), and $Y$ an outcome
of interest (e.g., disease status). Here, we consider $A$ that are
continuous-valued (i.e., $A \in \R$) or ordinal with many levels. For a given
study, we consider observing $n$ independent and identically distributed units
$O_1, \ldots, O_n$.

Following [the roadmap](#roadmap), let $O \sim P_0 \in \M$, where $\M$ is the
nonparametric statistical model, minimizing any restrictions on the form of the
data-generating distribution $P_0$. To formalize the definition of stochastic
interventions and their corresponding causal effects, we introduce a structural
causal model (SCM), based on @pearl2009causality, to define how the system
changes under posited interventions:
\begin{align}
  W &= f_W(U_W) \\ \nonumber
  A &= f_A(W, U_A) \\ \nonumber
  Y &= f_Y(A, W, U_Y).
  (\#eq:npsem-shift)
\end{align}
The set of structural equations provide a mechanistic model describing the
relationships between variables composing the observed data unit $O$. The SCM
describes a temporal ordering between the variables (i.e., that $Y$ occurs after
$A$, which occurs after $W$); specifies deterministic functions $\{f_W, f_A,
f_Y\}$ generating each variable $\{W, A, Y\}$ based on those preceding it and
exogenous (unobserved) variable $\{U_W, U_A, U_Y\}$; and requires that each
exogenous variable is assumed to contain all unobserved causes of the
corresponding observed variable.

We can factorize the likelihood of the data unit $O$ as follows, revealing
orthogonal components of the density, $p_0$, when evaluated on a typical
observation $o$:
\begin{align}
  p_0(o) = &q_{0,Y}(y \mid A = a, W = w) \\ \nonumber
    &g_{0,A}(a \mid W = w) \\ \nonumber
    &q_{0,W}(w),\\ \nonumber
  (\#eq:likelihood-factorization-shift)
\end{align}
where $q_{0, Y}$ is the conditional density of $Y$ given $\{A, W\}$ with respect
to some dominating measure, $g_{0, A}$ is the conditional density of $A$ given
$W$ with respect to dominating measure $\mu$, and $q_{0, W}$ is the density of
$W$ with respect to dominating measure $\nu$. In the interest of continuing to
use familiar notation, we let $\overline{Q}(A, W) = \E[Y \mid A, W]$, $g(A \mid
W) = g_{A}(A \mid W)$, and $q_W$ the marginal distribution of $W$. Importantly,
the SCM parameterizes $p_0$ in terms of the distribution of random variables
$(O, U)$ modeled by the system of equations. In turn, this implies a model for
the distribution of counterfactual random variables generated by interventions
on the data-generating process.

## Defining the Causal Effect of a Stochastic Intervention

Causal effects are defined in terms of contrasts of hypothetical interventions
on the SCM \@ref(eq:npsem-shift). Stochastic interventions modifying
components of the SCM may be thought of in two equivalent ways. A _general_
stochastic intervention replaces the equation $f_A$, which gives rise to $A$,
and $g(A \mid W)$, the natural conditional density of A, with a candidate
density $g_{A_{\delta}}(A \mid W)$. In the absence of the intervention, we would
consider any given value $a \in \mathcal{A}$, the support of $A$ -- that is, the
result of evaluating the function $f_A$ at a given value $W = w$ -- as the
result of a random draw from the distribution defined by the conditional density
$g(A \mid W)$, that is, $A_{\delta} \sim g_{A_{\delta}}(\cdot \mid W)$. In
applying the intervention, we simply remove the structural equation $f_A$,
instead drawing the post-intervention value $A_{\delta}$ from the distribution
defined by the candidate density $g_{A_{\delta}}(A \mid W)$. The
post-intervention value $A_{\delta}$ is stochastically modified in the sense
that it has been drawn from an arbitrary (in practice, user-defined)
distribution. Note that the familiar case of static interventions can be
recovered by choosing degenerate candidate distributions, which place all mass
on just a single value. @stock1989nonparametric first considered estimating the
total effects of such stochastic interventions.

While there are few restrictions on the choice of the candidate post-treatment
density $g_{A_{\delta}}(A \mid W)$, in practice, it is often chosen based on
knowledge of the natural (or pre-intervention) density $g(A \mid W)$. When
$g_{A_{\delta}}(A \mid W)$ is _piecewise smooth invertible_ (more below)
[@haneuse2013estimation], there is a direct correspondence between the
post-intervention density $g_{A_{\delta}}(A \mid W)$ and a function $d(A, W;
\delta)$ that maps an observed pair $\{A, W\}$ to the post-intervention quantity
$A_{\delta}$. In such cases, the stochastic intervention, defined by $d(A, W;
\delta)$, is said to depend on the natural value of treatment and has been
termed a _modified treatment policy_ (MTP) [@haneuse2013estimation;
@diaz2018stochastic; @hejazi2021semiparametric]. @haneuse2013estimation and
@young2014identification provide detailed discussions contrasting the
interpretations of the causal effects under modified treatment policies and
general stochastic interventions.

::: {.definition name="Piecewise Smooth Invertibility"}
For each $w \in \mathcal{W}$, assume that the interval $\mathcal{I}(w) =
(l(w,), u(w))$ may be partitioned into subintervals $\mathcal{I}_{\delta,j}(w):
j = 1, \ldots, J(w)$ such that $d(a, w; \delta)$ is equal to some $d_j(a, w;
\delta)$ in $\mathcal{I}_{\delta,j}(w)$ and $d_j(\cdot,w; \delta)$ has inverse
function $b_j(\cdot, w; \delta)$ with derivative $b_j'(\cdot, w; \delta)$.
:::
<!-- TODO: explain this
Essentially, for a given $d(A,W; \delta)$ to exhibit this property, the
-->

A stochastic intervention gives rise to a counterfactual random variable
$Y_{A_{\delta}} := f_Y(A_{\delta}, W, U_Y)$, where the counterfactual outcome
$Y_{A_{\delta}} \sim \mathcal{P}_0^{A_{\delta}}$ arises from replacing the
natural value of $A$ with $A_{\delta}$ (whether as a draw from
$g_{A_{\delta}}(A \mid W)$ or by evaluating $d(A, W; \delta)$). For the
remainder of this chapter, we will focus on additive MTPs of the form
\begin{equation}
  d(a, w; \delta) =
  \begin{cases}
    a + \delta & \text{if } a + \delta \leq u(w) \\
    a & \text{if } a + \delta > u(w),
  \end{cases}
  (\#eq:shift)
\end{equation}
where $\delta \in \mathbb{R}$ defines the degree to which an observed $A = a$
ought to be shifted, in the context of the stratum $W = w$, and $l(w)$ and
$u(w)$ are the minimum and maximum values of the treatment $A$ in the stratum
$W = w$. Consider, for example, the case where $A$ denotes a (continuous-valued)
dosage of nutritional supplements (e.g., number of vitamin pills) and assume
that the distribution of $A$ conditional on $W = w$ has support in the interval
$(l(w), u(w))$. That is, the minimum number of pills taken for an individual
with in the covariate stratum defined by $W = w$ is $l(w)$; similarly, the
maximum is $u(w)$. Such a stochastic intervention may be interpreted as the
result of a clinic policy encouraging individuals to consume $\delta$ more
vitamin pills ($A \delta$) than they would normally be recommended ($A$) based
on their baseline characteristics $W$. This class of stochastic interventions
was introduced by @diaz2012population and has been further discussed in
@haneuse2013estimation, @diaz2018stochastic, @hejazi2020efficient, and
@hejazi2021semiparametric. This class of interventions may be expressed as a
general stochastic intervention, as per @diaz2012population, by considering the
random draw $\P_{A_{\delta}}(g_{0, A})(A = a \mid W) = g_{0,A}(a - \delta(W)
\mid W)$.

In order to evaluate the causal effect of our intervention, we consider as a
parameter of interest the counterfactual mean of the outcome under our
stochastically modified intervention distribution. This target causal estimand
is $\psi_{0, \delta} \coloneqq \E_{P_0^{A_{\delta}}}\{Y_{A_{\delta}}\}$, the
mean of the counterfactual outcome variable $Y_{A_{\delta}}$.
@diaz2018stochastic showed that $\psi_{0, \delta}$ may be identified by a
functional of the distribution of $O$:
\begin{align}
  \psi_{0,\delta} = \int_{\mathcal{W}} \int_{\mathcal{A}} & \E_{P_0}
   \{Y \mid A = d(a, w), W = w\} \nonumber \\ &q_{0, A}(a \mid W = w)
   q_{0, W}(w) d\mu(a)d\nu(w).
  (\#eq:identification2012)
\end{align}
Under certain identification conditions, which we will enumerate shortly, the
statistical parameter in Equation \@ref(eq:identification2012) matches exactly
the counterfactual mean $\psi_{0, \delta}$. While this book is not concerned
with the identification of causal parameters -- that is, establishing
statistical functionals of the observed data that have causal interpretations
under certain assumptions -- we review key assumptions for identifying the
counterfactual mean $\psi_{0, \delta}$ below. As the SCM introduced prior
generates independent and identically distributed units $O$, the common
identification assumptions of consistency ($Y^{A_{\delta,i}}_i = Y_i$ in the
event $A_i = d(a_i, w_i)$, for $i = 1, \ldots, n$) and lack of interference
($Y^{A_{\delta,i}}_i$ does not depend on $d(a_j, w_j)$ for $i = 1, \ldots, n$
and $j \neq i$) hold. Beyond these, we require no unmeasured confounding (the
analog to the randomization assumption in observational studies) and positivity.

::: {.definition name="No Unmeasured Confounding"}
$A_i \indep Y^{A_{\delta,i}}_i \mid W_i$, for $i = 1, \ldots, n$. This is the
observational study analog to the well-known randomization assumption.

## Estimating the Causal Effect of a Stochastic Intervention

@diaz2012population provided a derivation of the efficient influence function
(EIF), a key quantity for constructing efficient estimators, in the
nonparametric model $\M$ and developed both classical and efficient estimators
of this quantity, including substitution, inverse probability weighted, one-step
and targeted maximum likelihood (TML) estimators. Both the one-step and TML
estimators allow for semiparametric-efficient estimation and inference on the
target quantity of interest $\psi_{0, \delta}$. As described by
@diaz2018stochastic, the EIF of $\psi_{0, \delta}$, with respect to the
nonparametric model $\M$, is
\begin{equation}
  D(P_0)(x) = H(a, w)({y - \overline{Q}(a, w)}) +
  \overline{Q}(d(a, w), w) - \Psi(P_0),
  (\#eq:eif-shift)
\end{equation}
where the auxiliary covariate $H(a,w)$ may be expressed
\begin{equation}
  H(a,w) = \mathbb{I}(a + \delta < u(w)) \frac{g_0(a - \delta \mid w)}
  {g_0(a \mid w)} + \mathbb{I}(a + \delta \geq u(w)),
  (\#eq:aux-covar-full-shift)
\end{equation}
which may be reduced to
\begin{equation}
  H(a,w) = \frac{g_0(a - \delta \mid w)}{g_0(a \mid w)} + 1
  (\#eq:aux-covar-simple-shift)
\end{equation}
when the treatment $A$ lies within the limits defined by the covariate strata
$W$, that is, for $A_i \in (u(w) - \delta, u(w))$. The efficient influence
function is a key ingredient in the construction of semiparametric-efficient
estimators. Next, we focus on a targeted maximum likelihood (TML) estimator, for
which @diaz2018stochastic give the following recipe:

1. Construct initial estimators $g_n$ of $g_0(A, W)$ and $\overline{Q}_n$ of
   $\overline{Q}_0(A, W)$, ideally using data-adaptive regression techniques.
2. For each observation $i$, compute an estimate $H_n(a_i, w_i)$ of the
   auxiliary covariate $H(a_i,w_i)$.
3. Construct the one-dimensional logistic regression model,
   $$ \text{logit}\overline{Q}_{\epsilon, n}(a, w) =
   \text{logit}\overline{Q}_n(a, w) + \epsilon H_n(a, w),$$
   or an analogous regression model incorporating $H_n$ as weights. Estimate the
   regression model's parameter $\epsilon$, obtaining $\epsilon_n$. The outcome
   of this regression model yields $\overline{Q}_n^{\star}$.
4. Compute TML estimator $\Psi_n$ of the target parameter, defining update
   $\overline{Q}_n^{\star}$ of the initial estimate
   $\overline{Q}_{n, \epsilon_n}$:
   \begin{equation}
     \psi_n = \Psi(P_n^{\star}) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i = 1}^n
     \overline{Q}_n^{\star}(d(A_i, W_i), W_i).
     (\#eq:tmle)
   \end{equation}

As [discussed previously](#tmle3), TML estimators are constructed so as to be
_asymptotically linear_ and are usually _doubly robust_. Asymptotic linearity
means that the asymptotic difference between the estimator $\psi_n$ and the
target parameter $\psi_0$ can be expressed in terms of the EIF, that is,
\begin{equation}
  \sqrt{n}(\psi_n - \psi_0) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}\sum_{i=1}^n D(P_0)(O_i) +
    o_p(1).
  (\#eq:asymplin-shift)
\end{equation}
Together with regularity, asymptotic linearity establishes a class of estimators
whose asymptotic variance is bounded from below by the asymptotic variance of
the EIF. This means that such estimators are solutions to the EIF estimating
equation (i.e., plugging the TML estimator $\psi_n$ into the EIF equation
results in a solution close to zero) and that their sampling variance may be
approximated by the variance of the EIF in closed form. This latter fact is
computationally convenient, as resampling methods (e.g., the bootstrap) are not
strictly necessary for variance estimation. A central limit theorem establishes
that the asymptotic distribution of the estimator $\psi_n$ is centered at
$\psi_0$ and is Gaussian:
\begin{equation}
  \sqrt{n}(\psi_n - \psi_0) \to \text{Normal}(0, \sigma^2(D(P_0))).
  (\#eq:tmle-gaussian-shift)
\end{equation}
Thus, an estimate $\sigma_n^2$ of the variance $\sigma^2(D(P_0))$ may be
computed
\begin{equation}
  \sigma_n^2 = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i = 1}^{n} D^2(\overline{Q}_n^{\star},
  g_n)(O_i),
  (\#eq:eif-var-shift)
\end{equation}
allowing for Wald-style confidence intervals at coverage level $(1 - \alpha)$ to
be computed as $\psi_n \pm z_{(1 - \alpha/2)} \cdot \sigma_n / \sqrt{n}$. Under
certain conditions, the resampling based on the bootstrap may also be used to
compute $\sigma_n^2$ [@vdl2011targeted].

<!--
Recall that the asymptotic distribution of TML estimators has been studied
thoroughly:
$$\psi_n - \psi_0 = (P_n - P_0) \cdot D(\bar{Q}_n^{\star}, g_n) +
R(\hat{P}^{\star}, P_0),$$
which, provided the following two conditions,

1. If $D(\bar{Q}_n^{\star}, g_n)$ converges to $D(P_0)$ in $L_2(P_0)$ norm, and
2. the size of the class of functions considered for estimation of
   $\bar{Q}_n^{\star}$ and $g_n$ is bounded (technically, $\exists \mathcal{F}$
   such that $D(\bar{Q}_n^{\star}, g_n) \in \mathcal{F}$ _whp_, where
   $\mathcal{F}$ is a Donsker class),
readily admits the conclusion that
$\psi_n - \psi_0 = (P_n - P_0) \cdot D(P_0) + R(\hat{P}^{\star}, P_0)$.

Under the additional condition that the remainder term $R(\hat{P}^{\star},
P_0)$ decays as $o_P \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{n}} \right)$, we have that $$\psi_n
- \psi_0 = (P_n - P_0) \cdot D(P_0) + o_P \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{n}} \right),$$
which, by a central limit theorem, establishes a Gaussian limiting distribution
for the estimator:

$$\sqrt{n}(\psi_n - \psi) \to N(0, V(D(P_0))),$$ where $V(D(P_0))$ is the
variance of the efficient influence curve (canonical gradient) when $\psi$
admits an asymptotically linear representation.

The above implies that $\psi_n$ is a $\sqrt{n}$-consistent estimator of $\psi$,
that it is asymptotically normal (as given above), and that it is locally
efficient. This allows us to build Wald-type confidence intervals in a
straightforward manner:

$$\psi_n \pm z_{\alpha} \cdot \frac{\sigma_n}{\sqrt{n}},$$
where $\sigma_n^2$ is an estimator of $V(D(P_0))$. The estimator $\sigma_n^2$
may be obtained using the bootstrap or computed directly via the following

$$\sigma_n^2 = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i = 1}^{n} D^2(\bar{Q}_n^{\star}, g_n)(O_i)$$

## Evaluating the Causal Effect of a Stochastic Intervention

To start, let's load the packages we'll be using throughout our simple data example


```r
library(data.table)
library(haldensify)
library(sl3)
library(tmle3)
library(tmle3shift)
```

We need to estimate two components of the likelihood in order to construct a TML
estimator. The first of these components is the outcome regression,
$\overline{Q}_n$, which is a simple regression of the form $\E[Y \mid A,W]$. An
estimate for such a quantity may be constructed using the Super Learner
algorithm. We construct the components of an `sl3`-style Super Learner for a
regression below, using a small variety of parametric and nonparametric
regression techniques:


```r
# learners used for conditional mean of the outcome
mean_lrnr <- Lrnr_mean$new()
fglm_lrnr <- Lrnr_glm_fast$new()
rf_lrnr <- Lrnr_ranger$new()
hal_lrnr <- Lrnr_hal9001$new(max_degree = 3, n_folds = 3)

# SL for the outcome regression
sl_reg_lrnr <- Lrnr_sl$new(
  learners = list(mean_lrnr, fglm_lrnr, rf_lrnr, hal_lrnr),
  metalearner = Lrnr_nnls$new()
)
```

The second of these is an estimate of the treatment mechanism, $g_n$, i.e., the
_generalized propensity score_. In the case of a continuous intervention node
$A$, such a quantity takes the form $p(A \mid W)$, which is a conditional
density. Generally speaking, conditional density estimation is a challenging
problem that has received much attention in the literature. To estimate the
treatment mechanism, we must make use of learning algorithms specifically suited
to conditional density estimation; a list of such learners may be extracted from
`sl3` by using `sl3_list_learners()`:


```r
sl3_list_learners("density")
[1] "Lrnr_density_discretize"     "Lrnr_density_hse"           
[3] "Lrnr_density_semiparametric" "Lrnr_haldensify"            
[5] "Lrnr_solnp_density"         
```

To proceed, we'll select two of the above learners, `Lrnr_haldensify` for using
the highly adaptive lasso for conditional density estimation, based on an
algorithm given by @diaz2011super and implemented in @hejazi2020haldensify, and
semiparametric location-scale conditional density estimators implemented in the
[`sl3` package](https://github.com/tlverse/sl3). A Super Learner may be
constructed by pooling estimates from each of these modified conditional density
regression techniques (note that we exclude the approach based on the
`haldensify` learner from our Super Learner on account of the computationally
intensive nature of the approach).


```r
# learners used for conditional densities for (g_n)
haldensify_lrnr <- Lrnr_haldensify$new(
  n_bins = c(5, 10, 20),
  lambda_seq = exp(seq(-1, -10, length = 200))
)
# semiparametric density estimator with homoscedastic errors (HOSE)
hose_hal_lrnr <- make_learner(Lrnr_density_semiparametric,
  mean_learner = hal_lrnr
)
# semiparametric density estimator with heteroscedastic errors (HESE)
hese_rf_glm_lrnr <- make_learner(Lrnr_density_semiparametric,
  mean_learner = rf_lrnr,
  var_learner = fglm_lrnr
)

# SL for the conditional treatment density
sl_dens_lrnr <- Lrnr_sl$new(
  learners = list(hose_hal_lrnr, hese_rf_glm_lrnr),
  metalearner = Lrnr_solnp_density$new()
)
```

Finally, we construct a `learner_list` object for use in constructing a TML
estimator of our target parameter of interest:


```r
learner_list <- list(Y = sl_reg_lrnr, A = sl_dens_lrnr)
```

The `learner_list` object above specifies the role that each of the ensemble
learners we have generated is to play in computing initial estimators to be
used in building a TMLE for the parameter of interest here. In particular, it
makes explicit the fact that our `Q_learner` is used in fitting the outcome
regression while our `g_learner` is used in estimating the treatment mechanism.

### Example with Simulated Data


```r
# simulate simple data for tmle-shift sketch
n_obs <- 400 # number of observations
tx_mult <- 2 # multiplier for the effect of W = 1 on the treatment

## baseline covariates -- simple, binary
W <- replicate(2, rbinom(n_obs, 1, 0.5))

## create treatment based on baseline W
A <- rnorm(n_obs, mean = tx_mult * W, sd = 1)

## create outcome as a linear function of A, W + white noise
Y <- rbinom(n_obs, 1, prob = plogis(A + W))

# organize data and nodes for tmle3
data <- data.table(W, A, Y)
setnames(data, c("W1", "W2", "A", "Y"))
node_list <- list(
  W = c("W1", "W2"),
  A = "A",
  Y = "Y"
)
head(data)
   W1 W2        A Y
1:  1  1  0.27165 1
2:  0  0 -0.66337 1
3:  0  0  0.11337 0
4:  0  1 -0.73256 0
5:  1  1  0.38884 1
6:  0  0  0.04399 0
```

The above composes our observed data structure $O = (W, A, Y)$. To formally
express this fact using the `tlverse` grammar introduced by the `tmle3` package,
we create a single data object and specify the functional relationships between
the nodes in the _directed acyclic graph_ (DAG) via an SCM, reflected in the
node list we set up.

We now have an observed data structure (`data`) and a specification of the role
that each variable in the data set plays as the nodes in a DAG.

To start, we will initialize a specification for the TMLE of our parameter of
interest (called a `tmle3_Spec` in the `tlverse` nomenclature) simply by calling
`tmle_shift`. We specify the argument `shift_val = 0.5` when initializing the
`tmle3_Spec` object to communicate that we're interested in a shift of $0.5$ on
the scale of the treatment $A$ -- that is, we specify $\delta = 0.5$ (an
arbitrarily chosen value for this example).


```r
# initialize a tmle specification
tmle_spec <- tmle_shift(
  shift_val = 0.5,
  shift_fxn = shift_additive,
  shift_fxn_inv = shift_additive_inv
)
```

As seen above, the `tmle_shift` specification object (like all `tmle3_Spec`
objects) does _not_ store the data for our specific analysis of interest. Later,
we'll see that passing a data object directly to the `tmle3` wrapper function,
alongside the instantiated `tmle_spec`, will serve to construct a `tmle3_Task`
object internally (see the `tmle3` documentation for details).

The `print` method of the resultant `tmle_fit` object conveniently displays the
results of computing our TML estimator $\psi_n$. The standard error estimate
is computed based on the estimated EIF.

## Selecting Stable Stochastic Interventions

At times, a particular choice of the shift parameter $\delta$ may lead to
positivity violations and downstream instability in the estimation process. In
order to curb such issues, we can make choices of $\delta$ based on the impact
of the candidate values on the estimator. Recall that a simplified expression of
the auxiliary covariate for the TMLE of $\psi$ is $H = \frac{g(a - \delta \mid
w)}{g(a \mid w)}$, where $g(a - \delta \mid w)$ is defined by the stochastic
intervention of interest. We can design our stochastic intervention to avoid
violations of the positivity assumption by by considering a bound $C(\delta) =
\frac{g(a - \delta \mid w)}{g(a \mid w)} < M$, where $M$ is a potentially
user-specified upper bound of $C(\delta)$. Note that $C(\delta)$ corresponds to
the inverse weight assigned to the unit with counterfactual treatment value $A =
a + \delta$, natural treatment value $A = a$, and covariates $W = w$. So,
$C(\delta)$ can be viewed as a measure of the influence that a given observation
has on the estimator $\psi_n$. By limiting $C(\delta)$, whether through a choice
of $M$ or $\delta$, we can limit the potential instability of our estimator. We
can formalize this procedure by defining a new shift function $\delta(A, W)$:
\begin{equation}
  \delta(a, w) =
    \begin{cases}
      \delta, & \delta_{\text{min}}(a,w) \leq \delta \leq
        \delta_{\text{max}}(a,w) \\
      \delta_{\text{max}}(a,w), & \delta \geq \delta_{\text{max}}(a,w) \\
      \delta_{\text{min}}(a,w), & \delta \leq \delta_{\text{min}}(a,w) \\
    \end{cases},
    (\#eq:delta-min-max-shift)
\end{equation}
where $$\delta_{\text{max}}(a, w) = \text{argmax}_{\left\{\delta \geq 0,
\frac{g(a - \delta \mid w)}{g(a \mid w)} \leq M \right\}} \frac{g(a - \delta
\mid w)}{g(a \mid w)}$$ and
$$\delta_{\text{min}}(a, w) = \text{argmin}_{\left\{\delta \leq 0,
\frac{g(a - \delta \mid w)}{g(a \mid w)} \leq M \right\}} \frac{g(a - \delta
\mid w)}{g(a \mid w)}.$$

The above provides a strategy for implementing a shift at the level of a given
observation $(a_i, w_i)$, thereby allowing for all observations to be shifted to
an appropriate value, whether $\delta_{\text{min}}$, $\delta$, or
$\delta_{\text{max}}$. The [`tmle3shift`](https://github.com/tlverse/tmle3shift)
package implements the functions `shift_additive_bounded` and
`shift_additive_bounded_inv`, which define a variation of this strategy:
\begin{equation}
  \delta(a, w) =
    \begin{cases}
      \delta, & C(\delta) \leq M \\
      0, \text{otherwise} \\
    \end{cases},
  (\#eq:shift-bounded-simple)
\end{equation}
corresponding to an intervention in which the natural value of treatment $A = a$
is shifted by a value $\delta$ when the ratio $C(\delta)$ of the
post-intervention density $g(a - \delta \mid w)$ to the natural treatment
density $g(a \mid w)$ does not exceed a bound $M$. When $C(\delta)$ exceeds the
bound $M$, the stochastic intervention exempts the given unit from the treatment
modification, leaving them to their natural value of treatment $A = a$.

### Initializing `vimshift` through its `tmle3_Spec`

To start, we will initialize a specification for the TMLE of our parameter of
interest (called a `tmle3_Spec` in the `tlverse` nomenclature) simply by calling
`tmle_shift`. We specify the argument `shift_grid = seq(-1, 1, by = 1)`
when initializing the `tmle3_Spec` object to communicate that we're interested
in assessing the mean counterfactual outcome over a grid of shifts $\delta \in
\{-1, 0, 1\}$ on the scale of the treatment $A$ (n.b., we make an arbitrary
choice of shift values for this example).


```r
# what's the grid of shifts we wish to consider?
delta_grid <- seq(-1, 1, 1)

# initialize a tmle specification
tmle_spec <- tmle_vimshift_delta(
  shift_grid = delta_grid,
  max_shifted_ratio = 2
)
```

As seen above, the `tmle_vimshift` specification object (like all `tmle3_Spec`
objects) does _not_ store the data for our specific analysis of interest. Later,
we'll see that passing a data object directly to the `tmle3` wrapper function,
alongside the instantiated `tmle_spec`, will serve to construct a `tmle3_Task`
object internally (see the `tmle3` documentation for details).

### Targeted Estimation of Stochastic Interventions Effects

One may walk through the step-by-step procedure for  fitting the TML estimator
of the mean counterfactual outcome under each shift in the grid, using the
machinery exposed by the [`tmle3` R package](https://tmle3.tlverse.org/).

One may invoke the `tmle3` wrapper function (a user-facing convenience utility)
to fit the series of TML estimators (one for each parameter defined by the grid
delta) in a single function call:


```r
tmle_fit <- tmle3(tmle_spec, data, node_list, learner_list)

_Remark_: The `print` method of the resultant `tmle_fit` object conveniently
displays the results from computing our TML estimator.

### Estimation and Inference with Marginal Structural Models

It can be challenging to select a value of the shift parameter $\delta$ in
advance. One solution is to specify a _grid_ of such shifts $\delta$ to be used
in defining a set of related stochastic interventions [@hejazi2020efficient].
When we consider estimating the counterfactual mean $\psi_n$ under several
choices of $\delta$, a single summary measure of these estimated quantities can
be established through working marginal structural models (MSMs). Summarizing
the estimates $\psi_n$ through a working MSM allows for inference on the _trend_
appearing through the grid in $\delta$, which may be evaluating through a simple
hypothesis test on the slope parameter $\beta_0$ of the working MSM. Consider a
grid of $\delta$, $\{\delta_1, \ldots, \delta_k\}$, corresponding to
counterfactual means $\{\psi_{\delta_1}, \ldots, \psi_{\delta_k}\}$. Next, let
$\psi(\delta) = (\psi_{\delta}: \delta)$ denote the grid of
counterfactual means in the grid defined by $\delta$ and let $\psi_n(\delta)$
denote TML estimators of $\psi(\delta)$. The MSM summarizing the change in
$\psi_n$ as a function of $\delta$ may be expressed $m_{\beta}(\psi_{\delta}) =
\beta_0 + \beta_1 \delta$. This simple working model summarizes the changes in
$\psi_{\delta}$ as a function of the parameters $(\beta_0, \beta_1)$, where the
latter is the slope of the line resulting from projecting the counterfactual
means onto this simple two-parameter working model.

A more general expression for the MSM $m_{\beta}(\delta)$ is $\beta_0 =
\text{argmin}_{\beta} \sum_{\delta}(\psi_{\delta}(P_0) - m_{\beta}(\delta))^2
h(\delta)$, the solution to the estimating equation
$$u(\beta, (\psi_{\delta}: \delta)) = \sum_{\delta}h(\delta)
\left(\psi_{\delta}(P_0) - m_{\beta}(\delta) \right) \frac{d}{d\beta}
m_{\beta}(\delta) = 0.$$
<!--
This then leads to the following expansion
$$\beta(\vec{\psi}_n) - \beta(\vec{\psi}_0) \approx -\frac{d}{d\beta}
  u(\beta_0, \vec{\psi}_0)^{-1} \frac{d}{d\psi} u(\beta_0, \psi_0)
  (\vec{\psi}_n - \vec{\psi}_0),$$
where we have
$$\frac{d}{d\beta} u(\beta, \psi) = -\sum_{\delta} h(\delta) \frac{d}{d\beta}
m_{\beta}(\delta)^t \frac{d}{d\beta} m_{\beta}(\delta)
-\sum_{\delta} h(\delta) m_{\beta}(\delta) \frac{d^2}{d\beta^2}
m_{\beta}(\delta),$$
which, in the case of an MSM that is a linear model (since
$\frac{d^2}{d\beta^2} m_{\beta}(\delta) = 0$), reduces simply to
$$\frac{d}{d\beta} u(\beta, \psi) = -\sum_{\delta} h(\delta) \frac{d}{d\beta}
m_{\beta}(\delta)^t \frac{d}{d\beta} m_{\beta}(\delta),$$
and
$$\frac{d}{d\psi}u(\beta, \psi)(\psi_n - \psi_0) = \sum_{\delta} h(\delta)
\frac{d}{d\beta} m_{\beta}(\delta) (\psi_n - \psi_0)(\delta),$$
which we may write in terms of the efficient influence function (EIF) of $\psi$
by using the first order approximation $(\psi_n - \psi_0)(\delta) =
\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i = 1}^n \text{EIF}_{\psi_{\delta}}(O_i)$,
where $\text{EIF}_{\psi_{\delta}}$ is the efficient influence function (EIF) of
$\vec{\psi}$.
-->
Now, say, $\psi = (\psi(\delta): \delta)$ is d-dimensional. We may express the
EIF of the MSM parameter $\beta_0$ in terms of the EIFs of the individual
counterfactual means:
\begin{align}
   D_{\beta}(O) = &\left(\sum_{\delta} h(\delta) \frac{d}{d\beta}
   m_{\beta}(\delta) \frac{d}{d\beta} m_{\beta}(\delta)^t \right)^{-1}
   \\ \nonumber
   &\sum_{\delta} h(\delta) \frac{d}{d\beta} m_{\beta}(\delta)
   D_{\psi_{\delta}}(O).
   (\#eq:eif-msm-shift)
\end{align}
Here, in Equation \@ref(eq:eif-msm-shift), the first component is of dimension
$d \times d$ and the second is of dimension $d \times 1$. In the above, we
assume a linear working MSM; however, an analogous procedure may be applied for
working MSMs based on GLMs.

Above, we utilized a straightforward application of the delta method to obtain
the EIF of $\beta$.  Inference for this parameter of a working MSM follows from
evaluation of its EIF $D_{\beta}$, which is expressed in terms of the EIFs of
each of the corresponding estimates $\psi_n(\delta)$.  The limit distribution of
$\beta_n$ may be expressed $$\sqrt{n}(\beta_n - \beta_0) \to N(0, \Sigma),$$
where $\Sigma$ is the empirical covariance matrix of $D_{\beta}(O)$. With this,
we can not only estimate the trend through the counterfactual means across a
grid in $\delta$, but we can also evaluate whether the slope estimate is
statistically significant, in terms of hypothesis tests of the form $(H_0:
\beta_0 = 0; H_1: \beta_0 \neq 0)$ and equivalent Wald-style confidence
intervals. Note that the estimator $\beta_n$ of the parameter $\beta_0$ of the
MSM is asymptotically linear (and, in fact, a TML estimator) as a consequence of
its construction from individual TML estimators.

The strategy just discussed constructs an estimate $\beta_n$ of the working MSM
slope $\beta_0$ by first evaluating the TML estimates of the counterfactual
means $\psi_{n,\delta}$ in the grid $\{\delta_1, \ldots, \delta_k\}$; however,
this is not necessarily the best strategy, especially when giving consideration
to estimation stability in small samples. In smaller samples, it may be prudent
to perform TML estimation targeting directly the parameter $\beta_0$, as opposed
to constructing it by applying the delta method to several independently
targeted TML estimates.

To do so, consider a TML estimator targeting $\beta_0$ (the parameter of the
working MSM $m_{\beta}$), which uses a targeting update step of the form
$\overline{Q}_{n, \epsilon}(A,W) = \overline{Q}_n(A,W) + \epsilon
(H_{\beta_0}(g), H_{\beta_1}(g))$, for all $\delta$, where $H_{\beta_0}(g)$ is
the auxiliary covariate for $\beta_0$ (the intercept) and $H_{\beta}(g)$ is the
auxiliary covariate for $\beta_1$ (the slope). Note that the forms of these
auxiliary covariates depend on the EIF $D_{\beta}$. Such a TML estimator avoids
estimating each of the $\psi_{\delta}$ in the grid directly, instead cleverly
concatenating their auxiliary covariates into those appropriate for $\beta_0$
and $\beta_1$. To construct a targeted maximum likelihood estimator that
directly targets the parameters of the working MSM, we may use the
`tmle_vimshift_msm` Spec (instead of the `tmle_vimshift_delta` Spec).


```r
# initialize a tmle specification
tmle_msm_spec <- tmle_vimshift_msm(
  shift_grid = delta_grid,
  max_shifted_ratio = 2
)

# fit the TML estimator and examine the results
tmle_msm_fit <- tmle3(tmle_msm_spec, data, node_list, learner_list)
tmle_msm_fit
```

### Example with the WASH Benefits Data

To complete our walk through, let's turn to using stochastic interventions to
investigate the data from the WASH Benefits trial. To start, let's load the
data, convert all columns to be of class `numeric`, and take a quick look at it


```r
washb_data <- fread(
  paste0(
    "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tlverse/tlverse-data/master/",
    "wash-benefits/washb_data.csv"
  ),
  stringsAsFactors = TRUE
)
washb_data <- washb_data[!is.na(momage), lapply(.SD, as.numeric)]
head(washb_data, 3)

2:          1            1        0            0          0          0

3:             0            1
```

Next, we specify our NPSEM via the `node_list` object. For our example analysis,
we'll consider the outcome to be the weight-for-height Z-score (as in previous
chapters), the intervention of interest to be the mother's age at time of
child's birth, and take all other covariates to be potential confounders.


```r
node_list <- list(
  W = names(washb_data)[!(names(washb_data) %in%
    c("whz", "momage"))],
  A = "momage",
  Y = "whz"
)
```

Were we to consider the counterfactual weight-for-height Z-score under shifts in
the age of the mother at child's birth, how would we interpret estimates of our
parameter? To simplify our interpretation, consider a shift of just a year in
the mother's age (i.e., $\delta = 1$); in this setting, a stochastic
intervention would correspond to a policy advocating that potential mothers
defer having a child for a single calendar year, possibly implemented through an
encouragement design deployed in a clinical setting.

For this example, we'll use the variable importance strategy of considering a
grid of stochastic interventions to evaluate the weight-for-height Z-score under
a shift in the mother's age down by two years ($\delta = -2$) or up by two years
($\delta = 2$). To do this, we simply initialize a `Spec` `tmle_vimshift_delta`
just as we did in a previous example:


```r
# initialize a tmle specification for the variable importance parameter
washb_vim_spec <- tmle_vimshift_delta(
  shift_grid = c(-2, 2),
  max_shifted_ratio = 2
)
```

Prior to running our analysis, we'll modify the `learner_list` object we had
created such that the density estimation procedure we rely on will be only the
location-scale conditional density estimation procedure, as the nonparametric
conditional density approach based on the highly adaptive lasso [@diaz2011super;
@benkeser2016hal; @coyle2020hal9001; @hejazi2020hal9001; @hejazi2020haldensify]
is currently unable to accommodate larger datasets.


```r
# we need to turn on cross-validation for the HOSE learner
cv_hose_hal_lrnr <- Lrnr_cv$new(
  learner = hose_hal_lrnr,
  full_fit = TRUE
)

# modify learner list, using existing SL for Q fit
learner_list <- list(Y = sl_reg_lrnr, A = cv_hose_hal_lrnr)
```

Having made the above preparations, we're now ready to estimate the
counterfactual mean of the weight-for-height Z-score under a small grid of
shifts in the mother's age at child's birth. Just as before, we do this through
a simple call to our `tmle3` wrapper function:


```r
washb_tmle_fit <- tmle3(washb_vim_spec, washb_data, node_list, learner_list)
washb_tmle_fit
```

- @haneuse2013estimation characterization of stochastic interventions as
  \textit{modified treatment policies} (MTPs).
- Assumption of \textit{piecewise smooth invertibility} allows for the
  intervention distribution of any MTP to be recovered:
  \begin{equation*}
    g_{0, \delta}(a \mid w) = \sum_{j = 1}^{J(w)} I_{\delta, j} \{h_j(a, w),
    w\} g_0\{h_j(a, w) \mid w\} h^{\prime}_j(a,w)
  \end{equation*}
- Such intervention policies account for the natural value of the
  intervention $A$ directly yet are interpretable as the imposition of an
  altered intervention mechanism.
- Piecewise smooth invertibility: This assumption ensures that we can
  use the change of variable formula when computing integrals over $A$ and
  it is useful to study the estimators that we propose in this paper.

- __Asymptotic linearity:__
  \begin{equation*}
    \Psi(P_n^{\star}) - \Psi(P_0) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i = 1}^{n} D(P_0)(X_i) +
    o_P\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}\right)
  \end{equation*}
- Gaussian limiting distribution:
  \begin{equation*}
    \sqrt{n}(\Psi(P_n^{\star}) - \Psi(P_0)) \to N(0, Var(D(P_0)(O)))
  \end{equation*}
- Statistical inference:
  \begin{equation*}
    \text{Wald-type CI}: \Psi(P_n^{\star}) \pm z_{\alpha} \cdot
    \frac{\sigma_n}{\sqrt{n}},
  \end{equation*}
  where $\sigma_n^2$ is computed directly via
  $\sigma_n^2 = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i = 1}^{n} D^2(\cdot)(O_i)$.

Under the additional condition that the remainder term $R(\hat{P}^*, P_0)$
decays as $o_P \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{n}} \right),$ we have that
$\Psi_n - \Psi_0 = (P_n - P_0) \cdot D(P_0) + o_P
\left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{n}} \right),$ which, by a central limit theorem,
establishes a Gaussian limiting distribution for the estimator, with variance
$V(D(P_0))$, the variance of the efficient influence function
when $\Psi$ admits an asymptotically linear representation.

The above implies that $\Psi_n$ is a $\sqrt{n}$-consistent estimator of $\Psi$,
that it is asymptotically normal (as given above), and that it is locally
efficient. This allows us to build Wald-type confidence intervals, where
$\sigma_n^2$ is an estimator of $V(D(P_0))$. The estimator $\sigma_n^2$
may be obtained using the bootstrap or computed directly via
$\sigma_n^2 = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i = 1}^{n} D^2(\bar{Q}_n^{\star}, g_n)(O_i)$

We obtain semiparametric-efficient estimation and robust inference in the
nonparametric model $\M$ by solving the efficient influence function.

1. If $D(\bar{Q}_n^{\star}, g_n)$ converges to $D(P_0)$ in $L_2(P_0)$ norm.
2. The size of the class of functions $\bar{Q}_n^{\star}$ and $g_n$ is bounded
   (technically, $\exists \mathcal{F}$ st
   $D(\bar{Q}_n^{\star}, g_n) \in \mathcal{F}$ whp, where $\mathcal{F}$ is a
